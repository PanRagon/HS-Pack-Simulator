    Tricky: even when simulating a click, we are still on a single thread.
    So, not all Promises in the component might have been resolved.
    Without getting a reference to such Promises, we cannot "await" for them
    directly.
    So, we create a new Promise which is going to be executed and resolved in
    the next step of the event-loop. Waiting for it will imply that all currently
    registered Promises are resolved.
    However, such an approach does NOT work when you can have tasks scheduled
    with setTimeout(), or when there are chains of Promises revolved after different
    ticks of the main event-loop.
